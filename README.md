# Peer-to-Peer Network Implementation

## Todo List

### Forming a Network

- [x] **Implement Peer structure**

  - Define the type `Peer` representing each peer in thes network.

- [x] **Implement Peer.Connect(addr string, port int)**

  - [x] Allow peers to connect to the network using an IP address and port.
  - [x] If no valid peer is found, start a new network with only the peer itself.

- [x] **Print peer information**

  - [x] After connecting or creating a network, print the peer's IP address and port.

- [x] **Set of peers**

  - [x] Each peer should maintain a set of known peers in the network.

- [x] **Request peer set from existing peers**

  - [x] When a peer joins, ask the existing peer for its set of peers.

- [x] **Join Message**
  - [x] New peers should broadcast a "Join Message" to notify the network of their presence.
  - [x] Existing peers should update their peer set upon receiving a "Join Message".

### Flooding a Message

#### Simple Flooding Solution

- [x] **Implement Peer.FloodMessage(msg <some type>)**
  - [x] Send the message to all peers in the peer set.

#### Advanced Flooding Solution

- [ ] **Advanced Message Flooding**
  - [ ] Ensure messages are sent to peers that have not yet sent the message to the sender.
  - [ ] Upon receiving a message, flood it unless the peer has already sent it.
  - [ ] When a new peer joins, send all previous messages to ensure message consistency.

### Keeping a Ledger

- [x] **Implement local ledger**

  - Define the `Ledger` type that maintains account balances.

- [x] **Implement Peer.FloodTransaction(tx \*Transaction)**
  - [x] Implement the flooding of transactions using the `FloodMessage` mechanism.
  - [x] Ensure each peer executes received transactions on its local ledger.

### Demo Program

- [x] **Implement handin.go**

  - [x] Start a network of `n = 10` peers (or less if necessary) on the same machine.
  - [x] Ensure peers pick different ports to avoid conflicts.
  - [x] Ensure the program is easily runnable on the TA’s machine.

- [x] **Send τ = 10 transactions from each peer**

  - [x] Use 5 accounts (e.g., account1, ..., account5) for transactions.
  - [x] All peers should send transactions related to all 5 accounts.

- [x] **Test ledger consistency**

  - [x] After all transactions are sent, verify that all peers hold identical ledgers.

- [ ] **Optional: Stress testing**
  - [ ] Test with larger `n` and `τ` to evaluate system limits (e.g., transactions per second).
  - [ ] Document crash or trash limits if applicable.

### Testing and Reporting

- [x] **Testing**

  - [x] Write automated tests for the system to verify its correctness.
  - [x] Describe the testing procedure and results in the report.

- [ ] **Advanced Flooding: Eventual Consistency**

  - [ ] In the report, argue that the system achieves eventual consistency if no more floods are initiated.

- [x] **Simple Flooding: Consistency Scenarios**

  - [x] Provide a scenario where simple flooding leads to eventual consistency.
  - [x] Provide a scenario where simple flooding does not lead to eventual consistency.

- [] **Transaction Rejection (Optional)**
  - [ ] Discuss how eventual consistency is affected if transactions that reduce an account's balance below 0 are rejected.
